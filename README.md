## 📚 Case Study

**EcoShop — Building a High-Performance Sustainable Landing Page**

**Objective**  
Create a modern, fast, and visually appealing landing page to showcase sustainable products — with a focus on performance, responsiveness, and clean code — so it stands out in a developer’s portfolio.

**Approach**  
- Used React with Vite for a lightweight, fast build setup.  
- Styled with Tailwind CSS for clean, responsive layouts and utility-first styling.  
- Broke the page into modular components (Navbar, Hero, Highlights, Products, About, Contact, Footer), improving reusability and readability.  
- Employed image lazy-loading to speed up initial load and reduce bandwidth.  
- Followed semantic HTML and accessibility best practices (proper tags, alt text, responsive design).  
- Deployed on Netlify to provide a live demo — easy to access and share with recruiters.  

**Outcome**  
- Fully responsive landing page that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
- Clean, professional UI demonstrating modern frontend practices.  
- Live demo link and source code available — ready to share.  
- Great base for further enhancements (real data, CMS, interactivity, analytics).  

**What I Learned**  
- How to structure a multi-section React landing page with modular components.  
- Importance of performance optimizations — lazy loading, minimal dependencies, responsive assets.  
- Real-world deployment workflow: Git → Build → Netlify, and preparing a project for portfolio presentation.  
- Good balance between functionality and visual polish even without backend or CMS.  

**Next Steps**  
- Add real product data and detail pages / modals.  
- Introduce headless CMS or JSON data feed.  
- Implement SEO enhancements (OG tags, structured data).  
- Add form handling or contact functionality.
